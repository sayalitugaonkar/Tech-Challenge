Getting Started

"Add the system information gathered above into a file called hosts.ini in the same directory as this README.md file. "

Additionally, because the path to the file is defined in ansible.cfg, it need not be specified when you run the playbook, so the playbook command could be, simply:

       ansible-playbook setup.yml 

Dependencies Instance running with Debian Buster
